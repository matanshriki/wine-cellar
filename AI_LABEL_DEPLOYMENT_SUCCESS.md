# ✅ AI Label Image Priority - DEPLOYED

**Date:** December 30, 2025  
**Commit:** `d03f357`  
**Status:** 🚀 LIVE IN PRODUCTION

---

## 🎯 Mission Accomplished

AI-generated label images are now **properly prioritized and visible throughout the entire app**.

---

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### **Image Priority Rule (Implemented)**
```
1. User-uploaded image (highest priority)
   ↓
2. AI-generated label image
   ↓
3. Default placeholder (lowest priority)
```

### **Centralized Logic**
- ✅ Single source of truth: `labelArtService.getWineDisplayImage()`
- ✅ No duplicated code
- ✅ Consistent behavior everywhere

### **Components Updated**
1. ✅ **BottleCard** - Main cellar view
2. ✅ **TonightsOrbit** - Tonight's Selection widget
3. ✅ **RecommendationPage** - Wine recommendations
4. ✅ **WineDetailsModal** - Already correct

---

## 🎨 Visual Enhancements

### **AI Badge Indicator**
- Small, unobtrusive badge on AI-generated images
- Shows "AI" with light bulb icon
- Semi-transparent black background with blur
- Positioned top-left on cards, top-right on orbit

### **Responsive Sizing**
- **BottleCard:** 16x20 → 20x24 → 24x28 (mobile → tablet → desktop)
- **TonightsOrbit:** 20x28 (all devices)
- **WineDetailsModal:** 40x48 → 40x52 (mobile → tablet)

---

## 📱 Platform Support

- AI labels visible in cellar grid
- AI badges clear and readable
- Hover effects work correctly
- Images scale properly

### ✅ Mobile (iPhone/Android)
- AI labels visible in cellar list

## 🔍 Code Quality

### Before:
```typescript
// ❌ Duplicated logic
{bottle.wine.image_url && (
  <img src={bottle.wine.image_url} />
)}
```

### After:
```typescript
// ✅ Centralized logic
const displayImage = labelArtService.getWineDisplayImage(bottle.wine);

{displayImage.imageUrl && (
  <div className="relative">
    <img src={displayImage.imageUrl} />
    {displayImage.isGenerated && <AIBadge />}
  </div>
)}
```

## 🎓 How It Works

### For Developers:
```typescript
// Import the service
import * as labelArtService from '../services/labelArtService';

// Get display image (ALWAYS use this)
const displayImage = labelArtService.getWineDisplayImage(wine);

// Use the result
<img src={displayImage.imageUrl} />
{displayImage.isGenerated && <AIBadge />}
{displayImage.isPlaceholder && <Placeholder />}
```

### For Users:
