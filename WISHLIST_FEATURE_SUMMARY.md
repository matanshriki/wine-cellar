# 🍷 Wishlist Feature - Implementation Summary

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**  
**Type**: DEV-ONLY Feature  
**Date**: January 9, 2026  
**Safety Level**: Production-Safe (completely disabled outside localhost)

---

## 📋 Executive Summary

A fully functional **Wishlist** feature has been implemented for Sommi. This allows users to save wines they want to buy later by taking a photo of the bottle label (typically at a restaurant), with AI extracting the wine details automatically.

**Key Points**:
- ✅ **100% DEV-ONLY** - Only works on localhost, completely hidden in production
- ✅ **Zero Backend Changes** - Uses localStorage (no database migrations, no schema changes)
- ✅ **Fully Reversible** - All code marked with `// Wishlist feature (dev only)` for easy removal
- ✅ **Photo-Based Flow** - Reuses existing AI label extraction
- ✅ **Complete UX** - Add, view, search, move to cellar, remove

---

## 🎯 User Story (As Implemented)

1. **User is at a restaurant**, tries a wine, loves it
2. **Opens Sommi** on their phone
3. **Clicks "Add Bottle"** → Sees "Add to Wishlist (dev)" option (amber button)
4. **Takes a photo** of the bottle label
5. **AI extracts** wine details (producer, name, vintage, region, grapes)
6. **User reviews** extracted data in a form:
   - Edits any incorrect fields
   - Adds "Restaurant Name" (e.g., "La Trattoria")
   - Adds "My Note" (e.g., "Amazing with steak - must buy!")
7. **Saves to wishlist** (stored in browser localStorage)
8. **Later at home**, user opens wishlist:
   - Sees all saved wines with photos
   - Searches by producer/wine/restaurant
   - Clicks "Move to Cellar" when purchased
9. **Wine is moved** to cellar and removed from wishlist

## 📦 What Was Built

### 1. **Core Service** (`wishlistService.ts`)
Location: `apps/web/src/services/wishlistService.ts`

**Functions**:
- `loadWishlist()` - Load all items from localStorage
- `saveWishlist(items)` - Save items to localStorage
- `addWishlistItem(item)` - Add new item
- `updateWishlistItem(id, updates)` - Update existing item
- `removeWishlistItem(id)` - Remove item
- `searchWishlist(query)` - Search by producer/wine/restaurant
- `clearWishlist()` - Clear all (for testing)

**Safety**: All functions check `isDevEnvironment()` and throw/warn if not on localhost.

**Storage**: Uses `localStorage` key: `wcb_wishlist_dev`

**Data Model**:
```typescript
interface WishlistItem {
  id: string;
  createdAt: string;
  producer: string | null;
  wineName: string | null;
  vintage: number | null;
  region: string | null;
  country: string | null;
  grapes: string | null;
  color: 'red' | 'white' | 'rose' | 'sparkling' | null;
  imageUrl: string | null;
  restaurantName: string | null;
  note: string | null;
  vivinoUrl: string | null;
  source: 'wishlist-photo' | 'wishlist-manual';
  confidence?: { ... };
}
```

### 2. **WishlistForm Component**
Location: `apps/web/src/components/WishlistForm.tsx`

**Purpose**: Review and edit wine details before adding to wishlist

**Features**:
- Shows AI-extracted data with edit capability
- Validates required fields (producer + wine name)
- Confidence indicator (warns if AI extraction quality is low)
- Wishlist-specific fields:
  - "Restaurant / Location" (where you tried it)
  - "My Note" (why you want to buy it)
- Save button with loading state
- Modal overlay with close on backdrop click

**UX**:
- Clean, luxury design matching app aesthetic
- Form validation with helpful error messages
- Success toast on save

---

### 3. **WishlistPage Component**
Location: `apps/web/src/pages/WishlistPage.tsx`

**Purpose**: Main wishlist view - see, search, and manage saved wines

**Features**:
- **Dev Guard**: Redirects to `/cellar` if not localhost
- **Search Bar**: Filter by producer, wine name, or restaurant
- **Wine Cards**: Shows each wishlist item with:
  - Thumbnail image (if available)
  - Producer + Wine Name + Vintage
  - Region, grapes, restaurant (if provided)
  - Personal note (if provided)
  - "Added X days ago" timestamp
- **Actions per item**:
  - **"Move to Cellar"** (primary, wine gradient)
  - **"Remove"** (danger color)
- **Empty State**: Helpful message with CTA when no items

**Smart Features**:
- Time ago formatting (Today, Yesterday, X days ago)
- Loading states for move operations
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions

---

### 4. **AddBottleSheet Integration**
Location: `apps/web/src/components/AddBottleSheet.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Added `onPhotoSelectedForWishlist` prop
- New option button: "Add to Wishlist" (amber/gold styling)
- Only visible when `isDevEnvironment()` returns true
- Shows "DEV" badge on button
- Triggers photo selection → AI extraction → WishlistForm flow

**Visual Design**:
- Amber gradient (`amber-500` to `amber-600`) to distinguish from regular add (wine red)
- Bookmark icon
- "Save wines to buy later" description

---

### 5. **CellarPage Integration**
Location: `apps/web/src/pages/CellarPage.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Added state: `showWishlistForm`, `wishlistExtractedData`
- Added `onPhotoSelectedForWishlist` handler:
  - Uploads photo to Supabase Storage
  - Calls AI extraction service
  - Opens WishlistForm with pre-filled data
- Renders WishlistForm modal when data is ready
- Reuses existing AI extraction infrastructure

**Flow**:
1. User selects photo via "Add to Wishlist" button
2. Photo uploads to Supabase Storage (reuse existing bucket)
3. AI extraction runs (reuse existing parse service)
4. WishlistForm opens with extracted data
5. User reviews/edits and saves

---

### 6. **Navigation Integration**

**Layout.tsx** (Desktop Navigation):
- Added "Wishlist (dev)" nav item (pill-style tab)
- Only visible when `isDevEnvironment()` returns true
- Positioned after "History" in nav bar

**BottomNav.tsx** (Mobile Navigation):
- No changes (keeps mobile nav clean)
- Users access via desktop nav or direct URL on mobile

**App.tsx** (Routing):
- Added `/wishlist` route
- Wrapped in `<PrivateRoute>` (requires authentication)
- Wrapped in `<Layout>` (includes navigation)
- No conditional rendering needed (WishlistPage handles dev check internally)

---

### 7. **Translations (i18n)**
Location: `apps/web/src/i18n/locales/en.json`

**Added Keys**:
```json
{
  "nav": {
    "wishlist": "Wishlist"
  },
  "common": {
    "moving": "Moving...",
    "remove": "Remove"
  },
  "cellar.addBottle": {
    "addToWishlist": "Add to Wishlist",
    "addToWishlistDesc": "Save wines to buy later"
  },
  "wishlist": {
    "title": "Wishlist",
    "subtitle": "Wines you want to buy later",
    "empty": "No wines in your wishlist yet",
    // ... (20+ keys for complete UX)
  }
}
```

**i18n Ready**: All user-facing text uses `t()` function, ready for Hebrew/other languages.

## 🔒 Safety Guarantees

### Production Safety Checklist
- ✅ **Route Guard**: WishlistPage redirects to `/cellar` if not dev
- ✅ **Service Guards**: All wishlistService functions check `isDevEnvironment()`
- ✅ **UI Guards**: "Add to Wishlist" button only renders in dev
- ✅ **Nav Guards**: "Wishlist (dev)" nav item only shows in dev
- ✅ **No Backend Changes**: Uses localStorage (no migrations, no schema changes)
- ✅ **Reversible**: All code clearly marked with `// Wishlist feature (dev only)`

### What Happens in Production
- `/wishlist` route redirects to `/cellar`
- "Wishlist (dev)" nav item is hidden
- "Add to Wishlist" button is hidden
- `wishlistService` functions return empty arrays or throw errors
- No console errors or warnings
- Zero impact on production users

## 🎨 Design Decisions

### Why localStorage?
- ✅ Zero backend changes (safest for dev-only feature)
- ✅ Instant read/write (no API latency)
- ✅ Works offline
- ✅ Easy to clear for testing
- ⚠️ Limitation: Per-browser (not synced across devices)
- ⚠️ Limitation: ~5-10MB quota (hundreds of wines)

### Why Photo-Only Add?
- ✅ Matches primary use case (restaurant scenario)
- ✅ Reuses existing AI extraction infrastructure
- ✅ Faster to implement
- ⚠️ Could add manual entry later if needed

### Why No Edit Function?
- ✅ Simplicity (MVP approach)
- ✅ Typical flow: add → review → move to cellar (one-way)
- ⚠️ Workaround: Remove and re-add if needed

### Why Amber Styling?
- ✅ Distinguishes from primary "Add to Cellar" (wine red)
- ✅ Visual cue for "secondary/wish" action
- ✅ Matches "dev" badge aesthetic
