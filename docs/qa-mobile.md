## 🔴 Critical Issues Found & Fixed

### 1. ❌ AI Label Generation Button - Returns Errors
**Status:** 🔍 INVESTIGATING

**Issue:**
- "Generate AI label" feature returns errors for users
- Not clear if it's a deployment issue, env var missing, or permissions

**Root Causes to Check:**
- [ ] Edge Function `generate-label-art` deployed to Supabase
- [ ] `OPENAI_API_KEY` secret set in Supabase
- [ ] User has `ai_label_art_enabled=true` in profiles table
- [ ] Global flag `VITE_FEATURE_GENERATED_LABEL_ART=true` set
- [ ] Storage bucket `wine-label-images` exists with proper RLS policies
- [ ] Button visibility logic in `WineDetailsModal.tsx` works correctly

**Files Involved:**
- `apps/web/src/services/labelArtService.ts` - Feature flag checks
- `apps/web/src/components/WineDetailsModal.tsx` - Button & error handling
- `supabase/functions/generate-label-art/index.ts` - Backend API

**Fix Applied:**
- Improved error messages to be more actionable (already done)
- Need to verify deployment status and configuration

### 2. ❌ Double-Tap Required on Some Buttons
**Status:** 🔍 INVESTIGATING

**Symptoms:**
- First tap does nothing
- Second tap works

**Common Causes:**
- [ ] Overlay elements blocking clicks (z-index issues)
- [ ] `pointer-events: none` on wrong elements
- [ ] Event propagation issues (stopPropagation missing/wrong)
- [ ] Focus/blur conflicts
- [ ] Framer Motion animations blocking interaction
- [ ] Backdrop close handlers interfering

**Areas to Check:**
- [ ] **Tonight's Orbit** bottles (`TonightsOrbit.tsx`)
- [ ] **Bottom Nav** links (`BottomNav.tsx`)
- [ ] **Cellar page** bottle cards (`BottleCard.tsx`)
- [ ] **Modal** action buttons (all modals)
- [ ] **Add bottle** FAB and sheet buttons

**Findings So Far:**
- ✅ `TonightsOrbit.tsx`: Proper `pointer-events: none` on overlay (line 256)
- ✅ `TonightsOrbit.tsx`: Proper `e.stopPropagation()` on button click (line 127)
- ✅ `AddBottleSheet.tsx`: Has workaround for backdrop propagation (lines 27-40)
- ⚠️ Need to check if this pattern is applied consistently everywhere

---

### 3. ❌ Scrolling Breaks / Content Clipped
**Status:** 🔍 INVESTIGATING

**Symptoms:**
- Can't scroll to bottom of modals
- Buttons hidden behind bottom nav
- Content cut off

**iOS-Specific Checks:**
- [ ] Using `100dvh` instead of `100vh` (Safari viewport bug)
- [ ] Safe area insets applied (`env(safe-area-inset-bottom)`)
- [ ] iOS momentum scrolling (`-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch`)
- [ ] Nested scroll containers (only one should scroll)
- [ ] Modal `max-height` accounts for bottom nav on mobile

**Files with iOS Fixes Already Applied:**
- ✅ `apps/web/src/index.css` - Global iOS utilities
- ✅ `WineDetailsModal.tsx` - Recently fixed scrolling (max-height: calc(100dvh - 2rem))
- ✅ `BottomNav.tsx` - Safe area support
- ✅ Layout padding utilities (`.pb-bottom-nav`)

**Need to Verify:**
- [ ] All modals use `max-h-mobile-modal` utility
- [ ] Forms in modals: submit buttons reachable when keyboard open
- [ ] Long lists: scroll works smoothly
- [ ] History page: charts don't break scrolling

---

### 4. ❌ Buttons Invisible / Unreachable
**Status:** 🔍 INVESTIGATING

**Check:**
- [ ] Buttons off-screen on small viewports (iPhone SE)
- [ ] Fixed footers covering buttons
- [ ] Safe area: buttons in gesture zones (bottom 34px on iPhone X+)
- [ ] Minimum tap target 44×44px (Apple guideline)
- [ ] Adequate spacing between buttons (8px minimum)

**Areas:**
- [ ] Modal action buttons (Mark as Opened, View in Vivino)
- [ ] Form submit buttons
- [ ] Bottom sheet actions
- [ ] FAB (floating action button) positioning

---
